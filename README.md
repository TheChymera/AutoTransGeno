# TransGenoHit

A set of tools to help determine optimal molecular biological experiment strategies for finding transgene integration loci.

The code is still pre-alpha and in part hard-coded for determining the integration site of an ePet-Cre mutant.
Use with caution, or best, open an [issue](https://github.com/TheChymera/TransGenoHit/issues) detailing what you want to do before using.
